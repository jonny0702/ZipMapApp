## Project Summary

The project called "ZipMap" addresses issues related to location and addresses in Panama, particularly in the land shipping industry. It acknowledges a lack of standardization in addresses, despite the advent of geolocation tools and the widespread use of GPS-enabled smartphones. The postal system in Panama is inefficient and has experienced corruption problems. ZipMap aims to solve these problems using technologies such as augmented reality (AR), GPS, databases, and artificial intelligence to map properties and assign them unique virtual postal codes. The goal is to create a comprehensive system of virtual postal codes and a modular ecosystem of software tools. The project is crucial to ensure reliable deliveries in an environment where the lack of standardized postal codes and address imprecision are significant barriers. ZipMap provides delivery drivers with an AR view to enhance delivery accuracy through unique identifiers (postal codes). It is divided into five development stages, starting with the creation of an API and mapping in a small area of Panama and gradually expanding to a national and international implementation. The experience in the hackathon provided motivation and the opportunity to bring this idea to life. The project was inspired by real problems related to the postal code system in Panama and AR technology used in London for supermarkets. Discipline and learning new technologies are highlighted as key elements of the process.
